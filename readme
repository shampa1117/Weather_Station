By default I'm loading default data. IF user enters any random value in text box and click on fetch he will get the default data. 
When user enters city name I'm placing that city in a collection and displaying it below so that user can visit back when he click the city. 

I have extracted data from forecast.io site for cities london, california, newyork, washington and toranto. and published this data to the site
we have limited data and we are showing only london, california, newyork, washington and toranto cities data.
